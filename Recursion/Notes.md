# Recursion
- A function calling itself with some base condition that terminate the function.

# Types of recursion
1. Tail recursion - when the recursive call is at the last statment of the function.it should not be returning with any other statement.
2. Head recursion - when the recursive call is at the first statement of the function.
3. Tree recursion - when their is recursive call more than once.
4. Indirect recursion.
5. Nested recursion.
